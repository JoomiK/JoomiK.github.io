I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. 

My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from marine algae. I simulated algae metabolism using [constrained linear optimization](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13081/abstract), designed experiments that resulted in a [patent](http://patents.justia.com/patent/20140303386) for increasing oil production in algae, and performed [statistical analysis of gene expression data](https://joomik.github.io/geneExp/). 

Lately I've worked on projects in [classification](https://joomik.github.io/waterpumps/), [regression](https://joomik.github.io/Housing/), [clustering](https://joomik.github.io/cluster/), [NLP](https://joomik.github.io/sentiment/), [topic modeling](http://partypoll.co/topics), [recommender systems](https://joomik.github.io/cluster/), [time series](https://joomik.github.io/robberies/), [Bayesian analysis](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), [MCMC](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), [image recognition](https://joomik.github.io/MNIST/), linear programming, AB testing, scraping, and survey design.


My undergraduate background was in environmental studies and philosophy, with minors in physics and biology. I love design, writing, psychology, and travel, and have written articles for Natural History magazine, published in academic journals, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). 

I spend way too much time reading about politics.
