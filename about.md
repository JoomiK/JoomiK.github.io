I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from marine algae. It was a lot of fun- I got to design experiments, simulate algae metabolism using constrained linear optimization, and do statistical analysis of gene expression data, including multiple comparison testing. 

These days, I spend more time on data that is directly related to people, including text data. Some of my projects have included predicting political leanings from tweets, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, AB testing different teaching methods, customer segmentation, pricing models, and Bayesian analysis. 


I also love writing, math, psychology, and travel. Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
