I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. 

My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from algae, but these days I'm happy to spend more time on data that is directly related to people. I've worked on projects in [classification](https://joomik.github.io/waterpumps/), [regression](https://joomik.github.io/Housing/), [clustering](https://joomik.github.io/cluster/), [NLP](https://joomik.github.io/sentiment/), [topic modeling](http://partypoll.co/topics), [recommender systems](https://joomik.github.io/cluster/), [time series](https://joomik.github.io/robberies/), [Bayesian analysis](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), [MCMC](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), [image recognition](https://joomik.github.io/MNIST/), linear programming, AB testing, scraping, and survey design.

For my PhD, I simulated algae metabolism using [constrained linear optimization](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13081/abstract), designed and led experiments that led to a [patent](http://patents.justia.com/patent/20140303386) for increasing oil production in algae, and performed [statistical analysis of gene expression data](https://joomik.github.io/geneExp/). 

My undergraduate background was in environmental studies and philosophy, with minors in physics and biology. I love writing, psychology, math, and travel.  I've written physics articles for Natural History magazine, published in academic journals, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
