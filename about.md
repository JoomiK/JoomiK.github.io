I am an oceanographer-turned data scientist. My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize sustainable biofuel production from marine algae. I got to design experiments, simulate algae metabolism (using constrained linear optimization), and do statistical analysis of gene expression data, including multiple comparison testing. 

These days, I spend more time on data that is directly related to people. Some of my projects have included AB testing different teaching methods, predicting political leanings from tweets, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, customer segmentation, price modeling, and Bayesian analysis. 


I also love writing, math, psychology, and travel. In another life, I wrote short and sweet physics articles for Natural History magazine, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
