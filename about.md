I love data science- check out some of my projects on this blog! I'm an oceanographer by training. My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from marine algae. It was a lot of fun- I got to design experiments, simulate algae metabolism using constrained linear optimization, and do statistical analysis of gene expression data, including multiple comparison testing. These days, I spend more time on data that is directly related to people, including text data. Some of my independent projects have included classification of Twitter users into political groups, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, AB testing different teaching methods, segmentation, pricing models, and Bayesian analysis. I also love writing, math, psychology, and travel. Oh, and I spend too much time reading about politics.
