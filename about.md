I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from marine algae. I got to design experiments, simulate algae metabolism using constrained linear optimization, and do statistical analysis of gene expression data. 

These days, I spend more time on data that is directly related to people. I've worked on projects in [classification](https://github.com/JoomiK/PredictingWaterPumps/blob/master/WaterPumps.ipynb), [clustering](https://github.com/JoomiK/WineDrinkers/blob/master/winedrinkers/WineDrinkers.ipynb), [NLP](https://github.com/JoomiK/Trump_Clinton_Tweets/blob/master/Trump_Clinton_tweets.ipynb), [topic modeling](http://partypoll.co/topics), [recommender systems](https://github.com/JoomiK/WineDrinkers/blob/master/winedrinkers/WineDrinkers2.ipynb), [time seies](https://github.com/JoomiK/RobberiesTimeSeries/blob/master/BostonRobberies.ipynb), [Bayesian analysis](https://github.com/JoomiK/AB-testing-teaching-methods/blob/master/AB_Testing_teaching_methods.ipynb), [MCMC](https://github.com/JoomiK/AB-testing-teaching-methods/blob/master/AB_Testing_teaching_methods.ipynb), [linear programming](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13081/abstract), [AB testing](https://github.com/JoomiK/AB-testing-teaching-methods/blob/master/AB_Testing_teaching_methods.ipynb), and survey design.


My undergraduate background was in environmental studies and philosophy, with minors in physics and biology. I love writing, psychology, math, and travel.  I've written short physics articles for Natural History magazine, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
