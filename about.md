I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. My PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from marine algae. I got to design experiments, simulate algae metabolism using constrained linear optimization, and do statistical analysis of gene expression data. 

These days, I spend more time on data that is directly related to people. I've done projects in classification, clustering, NLP, topic modeling, recommender systems, time seies, Bayesian analysis, MCMC, linear programming, AB testing, and survey design.


My undergraduate background was in environmental studies and philosophy, with minors in physics and biology. I love writing, psychology, math, and travel.  I've written short physics articles for Natural History magazine, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
