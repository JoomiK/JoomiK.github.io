I'm an oceanographer-turned data scientist. Although my PhD research focused on experimental and computational methods to optimize biofuel production from algae, these days I spend more time on data that is directly related to people. I've worked on projects in [classification](https://joomik.github.io/waterpumps/), [clustering](https://joomik.github.io/cluster/), [NLP](https://github.com/JoomiK/Trump_Clinton_Tweets/blob/master/Trump_Clinton_tweets.ipynb), [topic modeling](http://partypoll.co/topics), [recommender systems](https://github.com/JoomiK/WineDrinkers/blob/master/winedrinkers/WineDrinkers2.ipynb), [time series](https://joomik.github.io/robberies/), [Bayesian analysis](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), [MCMC](https://joomik.github.io/abtesting/), linear programming, AB testing, and survey design.

For my PhD research, I designed and led experiments that led to a [patent](http://patents.justia.com/patent/20140303386), simulated algae metabolism using [constrained linear optimization](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13081/abstract), and performed statistical analysis of gene expression data. 

My undergraduate background was in environmental studies and philosophy, with minors in physics and biology. I love writing, psychology, math, and travel.  I've written physics articles for Natural History magazine, published in academic journals, and [contributed to educational sites](https://ivyed.net/engaging-girls-in-stem/). Oh, and I spend way too much time reading about politics.
