title: AB Testing Teaching Methods with PYMC3
---
I participated in a study that looked at whether the order of presenting materials in a high school biology class made a difference in test scores. FOr this study, I analyzed the test scores for two groups of students- one where a new method of teaching was used, the other where the "old" method was used. I use Bayesian methods to estimate differences in the scores.
