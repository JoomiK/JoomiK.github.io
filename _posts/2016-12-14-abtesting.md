title: AB testing different teaching methods + PYMC3
---
This study explored whether the order of presenting materials in a high school biology class made a difference in test scores. I analyzed the test scores for two groups of students- one where a new method of teaching was used, the other where the "old" method was used- and used Bayesian methods to estimate differences in the scores.
