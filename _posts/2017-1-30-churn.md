Data: Telecom customer data  
Techniques: Calculating churn probability and expected loss, random forest

Here I look at a telecom customer data set. Each row contains customer attributes such as call minutes during different times of the day, charges incurred for services, duration of account, and whether or not the customer left or not.

Function that ties everything together and calculates expected loss from churn: 


```python
def ChurnModel(df, X, y, model):
    """
    Calculates probability of churn and expected loss, 
    and gathers customer's contact info
    """
    # Collect customer meta data
    response = df[['Area Code','Phone']]
    charges = ['Day Charge','Eve Charge','Night Charge','Intl Charge']
    response['customer_worth'] = df[charges].sum(axis=1)
    
    # Make prediction
    clf = model()
    clf = clf.fit(X,y)
    churn_prob = clf.predict_proba(X)
    response['churn_prob'] = churn_prob[:,1]
    
    # Calculate expected loss
    response['expected_loss'] = response['churn_prob'] * response['customer_worth']
    response = response.sort('expected_loss', ascending=False)
    
    # Return response DataFrame
    return response
```

### The data


```python
df = pd.read_csv('churn.csv')
col_names = df.columns.tolist()
col_names
```




    ['International Plan',
     'Mail Plan',
     'Mail Message',
     'Day Minutes',
     'Day Calls',
     'Day Charge',
     'Evening Minutes',
     'Evening Calls',
     'Eve Charge',
     'Night Mins',
     'Night Calls',
     'Night Charge',
     'International Minutes',
     'International Calls',
     'Intl Charge',
     'CustServ Calls',
     'State',
     'Area Code',
     'Phone',
     'Account Length',
     'Churn?']




```python
df.head()
```
![png](/images/ChurnHead.png)

### Preprocessing

The target label here is 'Churned' (Yes or No)


```python
# Get the target
churn = df['Churn?']
# Convert to 0 or 1
y = np.where(churn == 'True.',1,0)

# Dropping columns we don't need
to_drop = ['Area Code', 'Phone', 'State','Churn?']
features = df.drop(to_drop, axis=1)

# Convert yes/no to Booleans
yes_no_cols = ["International Plan","Mail Plan"]
features[yes_no_cols] = features[yes_no_cols] == 'yes'

# Get updated list of feature names
feature_names = features.columns

# Prep and scale
X = features.as_matrix().astype(np.float)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```


```python
X.shape
```

### Some basic models.  
I won't look for optimal parameters for now.


```python
# Models to try
models = { 
    'LR': LR(),
    'RF': RF(),
    'SVM': SVC()
}

# Paramaters to try (empty for now)
params = {
    'LR':{},
    'RF':{},
    'SVM':{}
}

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = \
        train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state = 0)

helper = EstimatorSelectionHelper(models, params)
helper.fit(X_train, y_train, n_jobs=-1)
```


```python
helper.score_summary()
```

Random forest seemed to be best.

### Get probability of churning
We might want to know the probability someone will churn in order to make decisions, like who to reach out to first.


```python
# Use 10 estimators so predictions are all multiples of 0.1
pred_prob = run_prob_cv(X, y, RF, n_estimators=10)
pred_churn = pred_prob[:,1]
is_churn = y == 1
```


```python
# Number of times a predicted probability is assigned to an observation
counts = pd.value_counts(pred_churn)

# Calculate true probabilities
true_prob = {}
for prob in counts.index:
    true_prob[prob] = np.mean(is_churn[pred_churn == prob])
    true_prob = pd.Series(true_prob)

# Add to dataframe
counts = pd.concat([counts,true_prob], axis=1).reset_index()
counts.columns = ['pred_prob', 'count', 'true_prob']
counts
```

The random forest model predicted (for example) that 75 people had a 0.9 probability of churning and in actuality that group had about a .987 rate.

### Calibration and discrimination
Calibration is a measure of how close predictions are to perfect predictions for a given group.
Discrimination measures how far the predictions are from the baseline probability of churning.


```python
print("Support vector machines:")
print_measurements(run_prob_cv(X,y,SVC,probability=True))

print("Random forests:")
print_measurements(run_prob_cv(X,y,RF,n_estimators=18))

print("Logistic regression:")
print_measurements(run_prob_cv(X,y,LR))
```

    Support vector machines:
      Calibration Error    0.0004
      Discrimination       0.0655
    Random forests:
      Calibration Error    0.0063
      Discrimination       0.0847
    Logistic regression:
      Calibration Error    0.0016
      Discrimination       0.0257


### Expected loss 
Finally, we calculate the expected loss by churn, sort by expected loss, and gather customer contact info.


```python
ChurnModel(df, X, y, RF)
```
