title: Change-point analysis with MCMC
---

Data: Time series of mining accidents  
Techniques: Change-point analysis, Bayesian analysis, MCMC

This project looks at a time series of recorded coal mining disasters to estimate when safety legislation was passed. I estimate when the change-point occurred using MCMC methods.
