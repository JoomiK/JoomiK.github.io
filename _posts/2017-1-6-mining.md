title: Change point analysis with MCMC
---
This project looks at a time series of recorded coal mining disasters from 1851 to 1962. 
Sometime during this period, new legislation was passed that changed safety regulations, but we don't know for sure when this change-point (switchpoint) occurred.
Here I gestimate when the change-point occurred using MCMC methods.
