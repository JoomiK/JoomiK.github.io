title: Predicting non-functional water pumps in Tanzania
---
This project is for a competition from [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/). Using data on water pumps in communities across Tanzania, can we predict the pumps that are functional, need repairs, or don't work at all?

The dataset contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, how it was managed, etc. 

### Outline:  
[Part I- EDA and cleanup](https://github.com/JoomiK/PredictingWaterPumps/blob/master/WaterPumps.ipynb)  
- The data  
- Visualizing water pumps and regions  
- Dropping some features  
- Preprocessing labels  
- Looking at features  

Part II- Modeling  
- Missing value imputation  
- Model selection and evaluation
