title: Sentiment Analysis
--- 

For this project I used the Twitter API to collect tweets about Trump and Clinton. The tweets were collected a few months before the election in 2016. I explored word co-occurrences, and in Part II, attempted to do sentiment analysis. Note: I did not have labeled data here, so I used short movie reviews to train my model. This is not expected to lead to accurate predictions of sentiment in tweets (especially of political nature), since this wouold not capture things like sarcasm (of which there is not shortage on Twitter). However, I did it anyway to try it out so that I would have a workflow ready for when I do have the opportunity to work with labeled data.
