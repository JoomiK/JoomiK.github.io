title: Predicting Political Leanings
---
I collected tweets from followers of two "third party" political parties in the U.S., the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party. 
I used this to train a logistic regression classifier that would predict political leanings based on text data, and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to explore topics of third party followers.
