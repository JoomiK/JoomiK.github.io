title: Predicting political leanings
---
I collected tweets from the followers of two "third party" political parties in the U.S., the Green Party, and the Libertarian Party. 
and used these to train a logistic regression classifier that would predict political leanings based on text data. I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to explore topics of third party followers.
