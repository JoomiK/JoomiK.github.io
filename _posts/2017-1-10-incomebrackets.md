title: Predicting income brackets
---

Data: Income data from the [UCI ML Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/census-income-mld/)  
Techniques: Random forest

I build a quick model to determine income bracket from imbalanced data- the income levels are binned at below 50k and above 50k.
